Hi Replit, I’m rebuilding my Bitcoin investment platform “CryptoPay” using screenshots and manual content uploads.

🔧 REQUIREMENTS:

✅ Use these technologies:
- React (with JSX)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite as the build tool
- Any backend (Node.js + Express, etc.) — **as long as it works in VS Code locally and I can edit it later**

🌐 SITE STRUCTURE (Must Match Screenshot Design):
- Navbar with: Home | Plans | About | Contact | Signup | Login
- Black and Yellow theme (clean and professional)
- “CryptoPay” logo should appear on all screens
- Fully responsive: Navbar must work on mobile with toggle menu
- Add hover effect to navbar links and highlight active page

📝 AUTHENTICATION:
- Functional **Signup & Login Forms**
   - Fields: Full Name, Email, Password
   - After signup/login: redirect to **User Dashboard**
   - Use sessions or cookies, not localStorage (I’ll change the backend later)

💼 USER DASHBOARD FUNCTIONALITY:
- After login, users should see 4 plans:
   - Basic Plan: $500 → $2,000 (4× ROI)
   - Gold Plan: $1,000 → $6,500 (6.5× ROI)
   - Platinum Plan: $2,000 → $15,000 (7.5× ROI)
   - Diamond Plan: $5,000 → $50,000 (10× ROI)
- Plan selection logic:
   - When a plan is selected, display **BTC wallet address**:
     `bc1qxq5vg8pqvu22897a4s5vk0as4dlske0j6mw5f8`
   - Save selection with status **"pending"**
   - BTC wallet should be **visible until status = "active"**
   - Copy button for BTC wallet is required

🛠️ ADMIN PANEL (accessible via /admin):
- View all registered users
- See selected plans and current status (pending/active)
- Click button to **mark plan as active**
- Once active, the user’s wallet address disappears from dashboard

💬 SUPPORT CHAT:
- Show floating **“Support Chat”** button (bottom-right)
- On click, redirect to WhatsApp:
  `https://wa.me/18653565182`
- Do **not** call it “WhatsApp chat” — keep it clean and professional

📈 LIVE DATA:
- Display a live Bitcoin price chart on the homepage (CoinGecko or similar)
- Show a **live payout ticker** like:
  “John from Canada just got paid $6,500 — 2 hours ago”
  - Randomize names, countries, and payout times

🧰 DEVELOPER NOTES:
- I’ll download the final ZIP and run it in VS Code
- So please organize folders properly
- No proprietary Replit database — use temporary session logic or in-memory store

This should be enough to generate a fully working prototype. Please implement all of this in one go. Don’t skip features.
